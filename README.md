# Traffic-Sim
A java based traffic simulator 

1 DESIGN OVERVIEW
The general overview is that with each loop of the engine, it calls the thread pool to run
methods in change of all aspects of the vehicles in parallel. Then at predetermined intervals
the engine unlocks the ability for the player objects to communicate with the user. These
player objects are being controlled in their own thread that deals with communication and
authenticating the user in the database.
1.1 Threading
There are several instances of threading in this program. a thread is used to handle the
server Socket, and each client that connects, and a thread pool is used to move the vehicles.
Every loop of the update method in the game engine calls a method called "RunThreadPool"
that creates a thread pool, adds all the runnable tasks to the pool and then blocks the
game engine thread until all the tasks are done. To make this possible all methods that were
previously used to update the vehicle position were changed into Runnables.
1.2 Server
The server package handles the communication with the game engine to the players. It
consists of two classes and one enum. The execution starts with engine who spawns a thread
of "ThreadedServer". This class is in an infinite loop waiting for new connections, and when
a new connection is found it adds a new user to the players array, spanws a new thread of
"ConnectionThread" and passes this player to the constructor. ConnectionThread is where all
the actual communication takes place. The class starts in "Authenticate" mode and prompts
the user for the username and password, if the supplied credentials are found in the database
then the player is authenticated and the mode is switched. The server then (depending if it
is unlocked) data is sent to the user.
1.3 Client
The client is a very simple package, it consists of an enum, a helper class and the comms
class which houses the brains. When the comms class is loaded, it takes in the message from
the server and using the helper class gets the state and the data in the message.
the class uses a switch case for the state and depending on which state it is does the
corrisponding action:
Push: print the message to the user
Reply: print the message and take in input
Authenticate: it sends the credentials to the server
Kill: print out message and close connection

1.4 Communication
The server communicates to the client through text in a formatted string as follows. On the
client side, a simple helper class is used to decode the message
[Data]\t[State]
The client simply replies back with a string that follows this format, as the server already
knows what state it is in.
[Data]
1.5 Database
The database is SQLite based. There is a class called "Database" that handles the communication
with the database. The jar is from this GitHub: https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc
and the code is based off the docs aswell.
The table is simple just has a few column
"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n"
+ " id integer PRIMARY KEY,\n"
+ " username text NOT NULL,\n"
+ " password text NOT NULL\n"
+ ");";
1.6 Using the software
There are two seperate programs
(1) Server
(2) Client
Server must be started first, then clients can be started. In the directory there are several
shell scripts to start each but they are also listed below:
To run the Server
Windwows:
java -classpath ".;sqlite-jdbc-3.45.2.0.jar;slf4j-api-1.7.36.jar;build"
Main.Main
Linux:
java -classpath ".:sqlite-jdbc-3.45.2.0.jar:slf4j-api-1.7.36.jar:build"
Main.Main
To run the Client
java -cp build Client.Main
After opening the client after the server you will be met with a success message and then
the first prompt from the server. In this example our vehicle has reached an intersection and
we went forward
Connection accepted!
Authenticated
You've reached an intersection, which direction would you like to go?
You can go: FORWARD(F) RIGHT(R) Or WAIT(W)
F
Changed direction
playing the game is easy simply supply the characters the system requests.
